What is quality?----->Quality reflects how well software complies with or conforms to a given design, based on functional (business rule, administrative function etc.)



1)Opportunity  Phase Focus:----->Understand what the client wants to do.
                  :----->Describe a solution  to meet their needs based on our previous project or engagement experiences.
                  :----->Determine what conditions  exist that could impact the effort if they are not addressed.



2)Delivery Phase Focus:----->Identify areas that strengthen the delivery team’s ability to embed quality practices and deliver a quality outcome.
                :----->Combine ongoing root cause analysis and continual  improvement to fix issues when problems occur.

•We must start with a focus on quality at the very beginning, when we are working on new deals with our current and future clients.
This is called the opportunity phase focus.



•Once we start the project, it is important that we focus on the quality in order to deliver what we had committed in the opportunity phase.
This is called the delivery phase focus.




McCall’s Eleven Quality Factors:-



1)Product Operation:-Usability(easy to use),Integrity(safe or not),Efficiency( responce fast or slow),Correctness( accuracy)



2)Product Revision:-Reliability(performance of the software or failer),Maintainability(maintainance according to feedback),Testability( validation the software)
                ,Flexibility(ability to change (adaption))



3)Product Transition:-Reusability(easy to reuse the content),Portability(transfer the program to different environments),Inter-operability(interface with other systems)
